# FastAPI instagram clone project

We will create an Instagram clone app and build the API that is required to make that work. We will focus on a few key concepts like posting, commenting and user authentication. We will also develop two clients for our api:

- [FastAPI backend API](https://github.com/thepixelboy/instagram-clone-api)
- [web client in ReactJS](https://github.com/thepixelboy/instagram-clone-frontend)
- mobile client in Android and Kotlin

That way you will have a complete understanding both web and mobile fullstack development.

## Setup

- Clone the project
- Install dependencies: `$ npm install`
- Start app: `$ npm start`
